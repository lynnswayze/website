            <h2 class="center" style="text-align: center">What's better than a fancy website?</h1>
            <p class="center" style="text-align: center"><em>February 21, 2026</em></p>
            <p>So many family law attorneys are worried about having a fancy website.</p>
			<aside><em>(Check out examples of "fancy" sites I've built <strong><a href="https://clfpa.com">here</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240926015817/http://roguefamilylaw.com/"">here</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://familylawfriend.net">here</a></strong>)</em></aside>

			<p>And don't get me wrong: a nice website feels good and has its place, but it's not more important than:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Speaking <em>directly</em> to who you serve best, using language that's actually relatable. Whether your best clients are moms who are child-focused, military vets, or those with special needs... 
						you'll catch far more clients with language that speaks to them, rather than generic SEO language that doesn't.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Giving an easy way to get a hold of you that isn't a "contact me form." Even better, an Info Kit which presells you before they ever speak with you</li>
					<br>
					<li>Providing, throughout your website, answers to common questions (in an FAQ, your blog, videos, etc) with real answers that actually represent what it will be like to work with you</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Your website's job is to give your <em>best clients</em> the ability to see themselves working with you and to make that process easy... and everyone else should 
			be able to self-select themselves <em>out</em> of working with you.</p>
			<p>To do anything less is just wasting everyone's time...especially yours. So don't get hung up on how it looks until you have a plan for addressing the above.
