				<blockquote>How you engage in sales and marketing should come from a place of cultivating relationships, not "acquiring leads" and "closing sales".
				</blockquote>
			<aside>Kudos to Nick Richstsmeier for inspiring this post's topic <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/eg/podcast/the-hell-of-ai-marketing-why-every-brand-manipulates-you/id1713227258?i=1000739651282">HERE.</a></aside>

			<p>If you've consumed enough information about marketing, chances are you'll have come across the idea of the "funnel". <br><br>
				A funnel is a marketing concept wherein it is proposed that you pull people through a defined and tracked journey from ad, to opt-in/squeeze page, to lead magnet, 
				to sales page/VSL, to purchase, and that if you simply optimize it enough, you'll be able to have a <a href="2026-02-22-how-i-would-create-proactive-clients.html">steady pipeline</a>
				of leads and clients into your business. It's a machine with inputs and outputs, backed by algorithms, social media advertising, and extractive marketing tactics.<br><br>
				Organizations like ClickFunnels, HubSpot, GKIC, Digital Marketer, and many others have popularized this idea to the point that many marketers and business owners have forgotten that <em>there is, in fact, a better way.</em>

				Better is to think about what you're doing in marketing as <em>cultivating relationships.</em> 
				<br><br>
				How you do your sales and marketing should come from a place of cultivating relationships, not "acquiring leads" and "closing sales".
				<br><br>
				The good news? When you can think of marketing as networking and building a network, all kinds of opportunities open up:
				<br><br>
				-> Maybe that person who wasn't ready to hire you today -- <em>but whom you stayed in touch with and impressed</em> -- refers 3 clients to you this year, all of whom pay you well and who you love working with. 
				<br><br>
				-> Maybe that old client comes back because your connection didn't stop when the case was finished, because you not only had more to offer, but because you treat every connection in your
				network as a valuable relationship to cultivate. 
				<br><br>
				-> Maybe you <em>never have to advertise</em>, because your network's referral effect does most of the heavy lifting for you.
				<br><br>
				A lot is possible when you decide to treat humans like they have inherent worth and a spark of the divine. <em>(Yes, even when their Inner Child is being noisy.)</em>
			<br><br>
