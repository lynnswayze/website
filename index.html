		<h2 class="center" style="text-align: center">The Vision You Had When You Started</h2>
		<p>Many of you came to this practice area from a place of deep empathy and often, lived experience:
			<ul>
				<li>Childhood experiences which shaped your desire for justice and fairness</li>
				<li>Experiences in law school which made you decide to step into this work</li>
				<li>Your own experiences with adoption, divorce, co-parenting, or domestic violence</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>And because of these experiences, you have a vision and a mission to use your law degree to do as much good as possible. Your heart is in the right place but reality doesn't seem to match what you know is possible.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="center" style="text-align: center">But there's a catch</h2>
		You know more than anyone how stressful family law is as a practice area. Despite being one of the most 
		in-demand practice areas available, you're still facing:
		<ul>
			<li>A glut of reactive, price-driven prospects who don't seem to "get" who you are and how you work best</li>
			<li>Too few cases that fit the kind of proactive, solution-oriented work you <em>want</em> to be doing</li>
			<li>Too many overwhelming choices when it comes to marketing and sales and tech—should you use AI? Upgrade your website? Start ads?</li>
			<li>Too many moments where the emotions and energy from your clients settles into your bones, and the only way out is through unhealthy habits</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>Something has to change or you're going to burn out and maybe, even quit the law altogether.</p>
<br>
		<h2 class="center" style="text-align: center">There's a better way</h2>
	<p>Imagine being able to work only with clients who you love, who value your expertise, and who are the kind of proactive and 
		peacemaking co-parents you <em>know</em> exist... but who never seem to come to you.</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>Being able to fill more of your practice with proactive consulting work, rather than endless trial prep</li>
			<li>Being able to get paid more upfront, rather than chasing invoices</li>
			<li>Being able to <em>love</em> what you get to do every day, with tools for managing stress in a way that actually works to make you feel better. (Because alcohol isn't sustainable and neither is stuffing it all down.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
			<h2 class="center" style="text-align: center">From Tactical to Strategic Lawyer</h2>
			<p>I help empathetic family lawyers to do a few things:
				<ul>
					<li>Develop strategic thinking when it comes to their business, especially their marketing, sales, and technology, so we're solving 
						for the <em>right problems at the root</em> rather than deploying solutions and finding problems to solve later</li>
					<li>Identify, document, and incorporate their unique Brand Voice to align with <em>who they are</em> and <em>who they work with best</em>, allowing them
					to turn their endless stream of leads into a pipeline of clients they love</li>
					<li>Navigate the uncertainty and hype of today's market to use technology tools <em>well</em> and in a way that aligns with their values and their vision</li>
					<li>Manage the emotional and energetic side of family law by learning skills from self-hypnosis, mindfulness, neuro-linguistic programming, intuition,
						and other modalities</li>
					<li>Explore alternative ways of working outside of litigation, such as unbundled legal services, divorce education, divorce coaching, 
						subscriptions, and limited scope arrangements.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
